# Drone-Admin-Panel

This is a simple **Admin Panel frontend** built using **React.js with Vite**. It provides a clean interface for administrators to monitor users and view data — specifically, a feature where the **admin can view the user's location** if the user chooses to send it.

The design uses **basic CSS** for styling, and animations are powered by **Framer Motion**, while icons are rendered using **Lucide React** for a modern, clean look.

## ✨ Features
- ✅ **React + Vite Setup**: Fast and lightweight frontend built with modern tools.
- 📍 **User Location View**: Admin can see the location of users when it's shared.
- 💡 **Lucide React Icons**: Sharp, minimal icons across the dashboard.
- 🎞 **Framer Motion Animations**: Smooth transitions and animations for UI interactions.
- 🎨 **Simple CSS Styling**: Clean UI with custom CSS instead of any framework.
- 🧩 **Component-Based**: Organized code with reusable components.
- 🔐 **No Login Required**: This version does not include authentication — it’s kept simple for demo or internal use.
